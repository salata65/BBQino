# Arduino projects converted to KiCad

This repository contains Eagle projects that have been automatically converted to KiCad (v4) format  by eakit.

The conversion is as far as possible identical to the original, but some features of Eagle cannot be converted directly to KiCad. 

They may (probably will) contain conversion errors - use at own risk!

If you find a conversion problem, please raise an issue here. In case of doubt, the Eagle project should be preferred. 

If you find a problem with the design of a project, or wish to make a feature request,
please do not raise an issue here, contact the original designers.
